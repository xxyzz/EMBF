    "2. Write down the formula that is used to calculate the yield to maturity on a twenty-year 12% coupon bond with a $1,000 face value that sells for $2,500.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2500 = 120/(1 + i) + 120/(1 + i)^2 + ... + 120/(1 + i)^20 + 1000/(1 + i)^20\n",

    "3. To help pay for college, you have just taken out a $1,000 government loan that makes you pay $126 per year for 25 years. However, you don’t have to start making these payments until you graduate from college two years from now. Why is the yield to maturity necessarily less than 12%? (This is the yield to maturity on a normal $1,000 fixed-payment loan on which you pay $126 per year for 25 years.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since you don't pay the loan right after you taking the loan, the yield to maturity must be lower than 12% to make up the price of the loan.\n",

    "7. When is the current yield a good approximation of the yield to maturity?\n",
    "\n",
    "    When a coupon bond has a long term to maturity (say, twenty years or more), it is very much like a perpetuity, which pays coupon payments forever. This is because the cash flows more than twenty years in the future have such small present discounted values that the value of a long-term coupon bond is very close to the value of a perpetuity with the same coupon rate.(from page 120)\n",
