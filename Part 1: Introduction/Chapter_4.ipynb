However, you don’t have to start making these payments until you graduate from college two years from now. Why is the yield to maturity necessarily less than 12%? (This is the yield to maturity on a normal \\\\$1,000 fixed-payment loan on which you pay \\\\$126 per year for 25 years.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since you don't pay the loan right after you taking the loan, the yield to maturity must be lower than 12% to make up the price of the loan.\n",

    "\n",
    "    When a coupon bond has a long term to maturity (say, twenty years or more), it is very much like a perpetuity, which pays coupon payments forever. This is because the cash flows more than twenty years in the future have such small present discounted values that the value of a long-term coupon bond is very close to the value of a perpetuity with the same coupon rate.(from page 120)\n",
